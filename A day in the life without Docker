A day in the life without Docker

Instead of Docker -> Buildah, Podman, and Skopeo

CRI-O - a lightweight container runtime for Kubernetes. 

Buildah - builds OCI container images and can be built without root. A little more flexible than Dockerfiles

Can build with Buildah from a Dockerfile. Or you could build it from scratch or build from an existing image. 

Red Hat Universal Base Image - small container image based on RHEL. 

buildah bud is the command to Build Using Dockerfile

buildah from is the command to build from another image

by being able to mount the container with buildah, you can install files to it so that yum/dnf never have to be included in the image

podman is a daemon-less API for running, managing, and debugging OCI containers and pods

Same CLI syntax as Docker

Can also run Kubernetes pods

podman pod --help

podman pod is kinda like Docker-Compose, but using Kubernetes tech - it puts the containers into a pod.

ls /var/lib/cni/networks/podman

podman stop --all stops all containers

skoopeo can be used to push images to repo, inspect them, or sign them

Docker-Compose?
Opening ports? yes
