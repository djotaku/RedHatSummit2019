A year in the life of moving t open source agile integration

A New Zealand group

(mentioned being left off maps)

Spark - the speaker is the largest digital services provider in NZz

went fro mIBM WebSphere to OpenShift as part of their agile platform

Tribe = business unit

Each tribe has 5 squads. And those are also divided into chapters - makes more sense on the slide (slides will be posted)

They wanted to do microcontainers

So they did 50% like for like migration. The rest was edesigns to take advantage of the new platform.

for migration, they did all their planning in Q1 and then migrated more each quarter

in Q1 learned
Classroom training vefore proof of concept

early and wider involvement of developers in squad

in Q2 learned
huge amount of time invested in set up of monitoring nad logging.

Learned that re-eingineering and migratino at the same time is very hard

Had to go slightly against traditional AGILE team style in order to make it work, but it gave a more scalable team.

In Q3 learned:
that like for like is somewhat boring dev work


Going forward will be using new container native monitoring with Grafana

they have lots of dos and don'ts, but biggest is don't underestimate time migratino takes or the complexity of logging and monitoring

and do lift and shift first - re-engineer later. Do like-for-like first, then change it to take better advantage of the platform.
