Openshift 4: what this next year means to you, to us, and the industry!

50% of Fortune 100% and 30% of Global 500 are using OpenShift

fixed up install so that a full cluster can go up with one commandline command

or can create an answer file (in yaml) so that you can non-interactively create clusters

upgrades to OpenShift are now easy and can happen "on top of" the old version

Operators are really neat because it handles setting up pods, secrets, storage, etc. So the devs don't necessarily need to understand the underlying OpenShift stuff

YAML files that describe service provided can also be visualized
