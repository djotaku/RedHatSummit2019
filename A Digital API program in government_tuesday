A Digital API program in government (Tuesday)

API store - a central repo of Federal Department APIs

Wanted to remove the idea of APIs developed in silos. Even within the same silo, some people didn't know about APIs. So they were not being reused. 

Also, they wanted to have the APIs secured in a more consistent manner.

Wanted a way to keep track of who is using the APIs. Because sometimes people were taking APIs offline that were important to other parts of Canada-gov.

Each customer for ISED came with their own requirements, but didn't care about any other projects so there were a lot of one-off jobs. 

Provides consistent security by having that managed by the API store managers rather than by the API creators

lifecycle management is somewhat built-in with 3Scale (Red Hat product), but requires education to use well
